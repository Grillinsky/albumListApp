# albumListApp
A vainilla - javascript proyect inspired in Traversy MediaÂ´s Book list App. 

 App saves data on localStorage, you can add/remove albums from the list.
 added a "completed album" and a "randomized" reference code as well as a "Search" bar. 
 neither the REMOVE feature removes albums (tried with splice() and pop() and keep having an error) 
 nor the SEARCH bar searchs elements (after the second letter ALL TR elements go to display:none)
